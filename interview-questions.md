# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: object destructing makes it easier to refer to a value

  Researched answer: the destructuring assignment syntax makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects, into distinct variables



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: value, array and index

  Researched answer:
   array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
   arr.filter(callback(element[, index, [array]])[, thisArg])



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: a object holds values while a class can be used as a blueprint

  Researched answer: A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects.	
    A class is used to bind data as well as methods together as a single unit.
  An object is the instance of the class, which helps programmers to use variables and methods from inside the class.




4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: span only takes up the needed space, while a div can house more elements/code

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: you use react fragment to display information on a page

  Researched answer: A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: javascript, css, html

  Researched answer: media queries, fluid grids, flexible images



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming: programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
- irb: Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb is a portmanteau of the word "interactive" and the filename extension for Ruby files, ".rb".
- Instance variable: An instance variable has a name beginning with @, and its scope is confined to whatever object self refers to. Two different objects, even if they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.
- Ruby hash: is a collection of key value pairs
- Class relationships: In Ruby, all values are objects and all objects belong to a class. The class defines what data and behavior exist in the object.
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby: A getter method retrieves the value of an instance variable from an object. It is common practice to have the getter method’s name match the instance variable’s name.
A setter method establishes or reestablishes the value for an instance variable.
